## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


```{r}
polling = read.csv("PollingData.csv")
str(polling)
```

## we observe quite alot of missing data and only 145 observations
```{r}
table(polling$Year)
```
## in 2012 the polling team were pretty sure about the 5 states
```{r}
library(mice)
library(Rcpp)
simple_data=polling[c("Rasmussen","SurveyUSA","DiffCount","PropR")]
summary(simple_data)

```
## what I done is made a simple data frame and will be using it for multiple data imputation
```{r}
set.seed(144)
imputed=complete(mice(simple_data))
summary(imputed)
```

```{r}
polling$SurveyUSA=imputed$SurveyUSA
polling$Rasmussen=imputed$Rasmussen
summary(polling)
```
## now I am going to make my smart  model before using logistic regression. We will use test data as polls for year 2012 and training data set as for year 2008 and 2004
## I am going to use Rasmussen variable to predict the outcome. This forms the baseline model
```{r}
train=subset(polling,Year==2004|Year==2008)
test=subset(polling,Year==2012)
table(train$Republican,sign(train$Rasmussen))

```

```{r}
cor(train[c("SurveyUSA","Rasmussen","DiffCount","PropR","Republican")])
```

```{r}
mod1=glm(Republican~PropR,data=train)
summary(mod1)
```

```{r}
pred1=predict(mod1,type="response")
table(train$Republican,pred1>0.5)

```
```{r}
mod2=glm(Republican~DiffCount+SurveyUSA,data=train)
pred2=predict(mod2,type="response")
table(train$Republican,pred2>0.5)

```
```{r}
summary(mod2)
```
